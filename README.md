# How to compile
	1 - npm install
		to install all dependencies.
	2 - webpack
		to build all code in a bundle
	3 - webpack-dev-server
		this will create a server at:
		localhost:8080


# Libraries

	1 - bootstrap - style
		I decided to use bootstrap because the application
		need to be responsive, and bootstrap treat it
		in a good and simple way.

	2 - react - frontEnd Eng.
		I've been working with react.
		And react forces you to work in/implement
		separeted components.
		The project structure is dived in 3
		importants folders: test, App and public.
		App - all react components are there.
		public - all external libraries come here.

	3 - webpack - module builder.
	4 - webpack-dev-server - the server.


#Considerations
	I tried to follow the Acceptance Criterias:
	presentation framework, application structure,
	existing code reusability, organized code,
	use module loader, no generator tools and tests.
	I failed in create tests files.
	Thank you for the challenge.
